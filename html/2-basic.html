<h1><a class="header" name="hd01">Basic Game Rules</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" name="hd02">I. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Basic Game gives all the information needed to play a scenario in Wooden
Ships and Iron Men. Once this section of the rules is completed, play of the
game can begin. Later rule sections include an Advanced Game and an Optional
Rules section which provide more realism and corresponding complexity. There is
even an additional section of rules which allows players to design their own
scenarios.</p>

<p>The rules outline for the Basic Game follows the sequence of play for each turn.</p>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd03">II. Sequence of Play</a></h2>
<p>Once the game has been set up, play begins. The game is played in turns (representing approximately three minutes). Most scenarios have no limit to the number of turns contained therein. Each turn is divided into eight phases. The sequence of play for each turn is as follows:</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Unfouling Phase: Make attempts to unfoul ships which were fouled on previous turns.</li>
  <li>Movement Notation Phase: Players secretly write in the proposed movements for each ship on their log sheets.</li>
  <li>Movement Execution Phase: When both players have completed their log notations, all simultaneously move exactly as their movement was written in the log. Retrace any possible collisions one hex at a time. if any collisions occur check for fouling.</li>
  <li>Grappling and Ungrappling Phase: Make all attempts to grapple, avoid grappling, and ungrapple.</li>
  <li>Boarding Preparation Phase: Write any boarding parties in the logs of the involved ships.</li>
  <li>Combat Phase: Resolve all gunfire, and mark all hits on the hit boxes of the log sheet.</li>
  <li>Melee Phase: Resolve all boarding actions, and mark all crew hits on the log sheet.</li>
  <li>Load Phase: Load broadsides.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd04">III. Unfouling Phase</a></h2>
<p>Ships which have fouled their rigging (i.e., have entangled their rigging
with that of other ships) on previous moves and have not been able to unfoul
may attempt to unfoul. Ships attempting to unfoul use the Unfouling Table.
Players need not attempt to unfoul if they do not wish to; however, they may
roll one die for each of their ships that is fouled. If unfouling is
successful, both ships that have unfouled may move normally on that turn. If a
ship is fouled with more than one ship, a player may roll once for each fouled
enemy ship.</p>

<p>If after the completion of all unfouling attempts, any ship still remains
fouled to one or more enemy ships, it must wait till next turn to attempt to
unfoul.</p>

<p>Successful Unfouling is noted by writing (F) in the notes section of the
log.</p>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd05">IV. Movement Notation Phase</a></h2>
<p>All ships are moved simultaneously. The move of each ship must be written
secretly in the log before any ship can actually be moved on the mapboard.</p>

<h3>A. Movement and Turning Allowance</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Before writing orders, the movement allowance for each ship must be
  determined. This movement allowance is a combination of a ship's battle sail
  speed and its attitude to the wind direction.</li>
  <li>The battle sail speed of each ship is printed on the counter adjacent to
  the stern of the ship diagram (see 11, C. 2 of Introduction to Rules). All
  ships have a battle sail speed of either&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4.
<p class="Error">(Meaningless cross reference...)</p>
</li>
  <li>Along with the battle sail speed the attitude of the ship in relation to
  the wind must be determined. There are four attitudes to the wind for each
  ship, labeled A, B, C, D. Each letter represents a different position of the
  ship in relation to the direction that the wind is blowing. See diagram:<br>
  <img src="files/attitudes.gif" alt="Attitudes" width="278" height="611">
</li>
<li>The movement allowance is now checked on one of these two charts:<br>
  <img src="files/battlesail.gif" alt="Battlesail Speeds" width="305" height="175">
  Examples:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>A ship with a battle sail speed of&nbsp;3 starts the movement notation
    phase in attitude C in relation to wind direction. Its movement allowance is
    determined to be&nbsp;1.</li>
    <li>A ship with a battle sail factor of&nbsp;4 starts the movement notation
    phase in attitude A. Its movement allowance is&nbsp;4.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>The movement allowance is the maximum number of hexes a ship may move in a
  movement phase. A ship may only move into a hex toward which its bow is
  pointing; i.e., a ship can't move sideways or backwards (exception: drift-
  V, 8. 1. of Basic Game).
<p class="Error">(Meaningless cross-reference...)</p>
  Each hex a ship's bow enters costs one movement factor of its allowance. Once
  a ship has used all its factors, it must stop.</li>
  <li>Movement factors may not be accumulated from one turn to another nor may
  it be transferred between ships.</li>
  <li>A ship may use none, some or all of its movement factors available. The
  number of hexes a ship may move is up to the player within the limits of its
  movement allowance.</li>
  <li>A ship may make only one 60&nbsp;degree turn per hex in a movement
  execution phase. A 60&nbsp;degree turn is equivalent to turning the bow to
  face an adjacent hexside. Since each ship counter occupies 2&nbsp;hexes, as a
  ship's bow is pivoted 60&nbsp;degrees to point to a new hexside, the stern
  will swing into a new hex.</li>
  <li>The turning ability number on the ship counter represents the maximum
  number of turns that ship may make in a movement execution phase. Remember
  all ships are limited to just one turn per hex, so each turn must be made in
  a different hex. Although it may seem impossible for some ships to ever
  exceed their turning ability maximum it does become relevant in the Advanced
  Game.</li>
  <li>Each individual turn costs one movement factor of the allowance. (Exception: IV, A. 15 of Basic Game).
<p class="Error">(Meaningless cross-reference...)</p>
</li>
  <li>A ship may never make a turn if the cost would cause that ship to exceed
  its movement allowance.</li>
  <li>The movement allowance for each attitude to wind also limits the number
  of hexes a ship may move while in that particular attitude. Example: A ship
  with battle sail factor of 4 starting in attitude A has a movement allowance
  of 4. If it turns to attitude C, it may only move one hex in that direction
  as the movement allowance for this attitude is 1. It may turn back to
  attitude A after moving one hex in C and finish its move in A Attitude.</li>
  <li>Rule&nbsp;12 does not work both ways. A ship with battle sail speed of 3
  starting her movement turn in Attitude B has a maximum movement allowance of
  2 even if it moves to attitude A later in the movement phase.</li>
  <li>Rule&nbsp;12 does not limit the number of turns in any attitude (other
  than the limit of 1&nbsp;per hex traversed), just the number of hexes into
  which a ship may move.</li>
  <li>A ship which has a movement allowance of&nbsp;0 may always turn in place
  60&nbsp;degrees. This is free.</li>
  <li>A ship which turns into attitude D must immediately stop and may not move
  or turn for the remainder of the movement phase, even if it has movement
  factors remaining.</li>
  <li>A ship's movement allowance may never be reduced below&nbsp;0.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Log Notations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All notations of the move column of the ship's &quot;log&quot;. The
  column is divided into numbered sections corresponding to the turns. All
  notations are written in the appropriate turn section.</li>
  <li>The number of hexes a ship is to move is written as a number.</li>
  <li>Any turns made by the ship are written as an &quot;R&quot; for righthand
  turn of 60&nbsp;degrees or as an &quot;L&quot; for a lefthand turn of
  60&nbsp;degrees.<br>
  <img src="files/samplemove.gif" alt="Move L1R1" width="212" height="283">
  Example: The ship is at A attitude to the wind and has a battlesail speed
  of&nbsp;4. Its movement allowance is determined to be&nbsp;4. The move
  notation &quot;L1R1&quot; in the &quot;log&quot; reads left turn 60&#176;,
  forward 1&nbsp;hex, right, turn 60&#176;, forward 1&nbsp;hex. This has
  completed the ship's full allowance. After its first turn into attitude C,
  the maximum distance the ship could move in that direction was one hex. If it
  wished to remain in attitude C, it would have to end its move at that point.
  Its move would have read &quot;L1&quot;.</li>
  <li>Notation must be specific and in the same order as that in which the ship
  will be moved.</li>
  <li>After completion of all orders, logs must be opened for inspection by the
  other players. Exception: The load column of the log may never be
  inspected.</li>
  <li>Orders must be written for each ship. If a player does not wish a ship to
  move, an &quot;0&quot; will be used as notation.</li>
  <li>If a log sheet is incorrectly filled out and/or indicates an illegal move
  for a ship, end that ship's movement at the point of the infraction.</li>
  <li>Ships which are to enter the game on this turn have their movement noted
  in their movement column. The first hex entered counts against their movement
  allowance.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd06">V. Movement Execution Phase</a></h2>
<h3>A. Movement</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All players move their ships simultaneously on the board.</li>
  <li>Ships which are scheduled to enter, enter and move in this phase.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Drifting</h3>
<p>This is a special type of movement. It may voluntary or involuntary.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Whenever the bow hex of a ship does not change or is not plotted to
  change for two consecutive movement execution phase during the second phase
  the ship will drift one hex in the direction the wind is blowing. Both the
  bow and the stern must be moved in this direction. This applies also to ships
  which a fouled or grappled together, if both ships a on at least their second
  consecutive movement execution phase without moving into another hex. Ships
  may turn in place and still fulfill drifting obligations (see 1V, A. 15, of
  the Basic Game).
<p class="Error">(Meaningless cross-reference...)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Ship of the line class vessels will drift on hex every other turn while
  drifting. Frigates and smaller class ships will drift one hex per turn while
  drifting. They will continue these rates until they voluntarily move at least
  one hex.</li>
  <li>Ships which are fouled or grappled together cannot move or turn in place,
  they can only drift.</li>
  <li>For each turn a ship is to drift, a &quot;D&quot; written in the move
  column.</li>
  <li>Ships which have lost all rigging-squares (become dismasted) drift with a
  special turning allowance.</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Dismasted ships with a turning ability of must wait at least three
    consecutive turns while drifting before being able to make a 60&nbsp;degree
    turn.</li>
    <li>Dismasted ships with a turning ability of must wait at least two
    consecutive turns while drifting before being able to make a 60&nbsp;degree
    turn.</li>
    <li>Dismasted ships with a turning ability of must wait at least one turn
    while drifting before being able to make a 60&nbsp;degree turn.</li>
    <li>If a dismasted ship makes a 60&nbsp;degree turn while drifting, it must
    wait the same period before making another turn.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h3>C. Collision</h3>
<p>Ships that cross the course or position other ships (enemy or friendly)
during movement phase may collide with the other ship.</p>

<ol>
  <li>To see if ships have collided, the players must retrace the courses of
  those ships involved one hex at a time. Remember, that a 60&nbsp;degree turn
  counts the same as a hex moved into. If two or more ships are found to be in
  the same hex at the same time in the move, a collision takes place.</li>
  <li>Only one ship can actually remain in collision hex. If the bow or stern
  of one ship is in the hex at the same point in movement when one or more
  other ships attempt to enter that hex, the ship occupying the hex remains.
  The other ship(s) move back to the hex(es) they occupied just prior to the
  collision. If the stern of a ship enters a hex in a turning maneuver at the
  same point in movement phase as the bow of another ship, the bow enters the
  hex. The turning ship moves back to its previous position. in all other cases
  that might occur, roll a die for each ship involved, and let high man decide
  which ship must occupy the contested hex.</li>
  <li>Ships will drift into a new hex on the last move of the phase.</li>
  <li>Once a collision has occurred and the position of the collided ships have
  been determined, all movement ends for the ships involved, even if their logs
  have been plotted for further movement. Log notation must be changed to
  correspond with the actual move.</li>
  <li>When a collision occurs, the rigging of the involved ships may entangle
  and be fouled, locking the ships together. For each collision, one of the
  involved players must roll a die. The result is found on the fouling table,
  and is implemented immediately. If the result is &quot;ships are not
  fouled&quot;, they may continue to move normally the next movement phase.</li>
  <li>Fouled ships cannot move or turn in place. On the second movement phase
  after fouling they must drift.</li>
  <li>Ships that are fouled may perform boarding maneuvers and melee that turn
  and/or any or all subsequent turns that they remain fouled.</li>
  <li>The fact that a ship is fouled is indicated in the Notes section of the
  ship's &quot;log&quot; by writing an &quot;F&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd07">VI. Ungrappling Phase</a></h2>
<p>At the end of the movement execution phase, any ship that occupies a hex
adjacent to a hex occupied by another ship, friendly or unfriendly, fouled or
unfouled, may attempt to grapple.</p>

<h3>A. Grappling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>One or both ships may attempt to grapple.</li>
  <li>A ship may attempt to grapple, once per turn. each ship to which it is
  adjacent.</li>
  <li>If the involved ships are friendly, grappling and ungrappling is
  performed automatically without rolling a die.</li>
  <li>If the adjacent ship is unfriendly, an attempt to grapple is made by
  rolling one die and consulting the Grappling Table.</li>
  <li>Grappling attempts on the same ship can be made in each turn even if
  previously grappled.</li>
  <li>As with fouled ships, grappled ships cannot move or turn in place. They
  can only drift.</li>
  <li>Boarding parties can be formed and boarding actions fought between
  grappled ships.</li>
  <li>The fact that a ship is grappled is indicated by writing a &quot;G&quot;
  in the notes section of the ship's &quot;log&quot; for each successful
  grapple.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Ungrappling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>After all attempts at grappling have been made in this phase, any ship
  which has been successfully grappled may attempt to ungrapple by rolling one
  die and consulting the Ungrappling Table.</li>
  <li>A successful ungrapple negates all affects of the grappling. Each
  ungrappled ship may move normally the next turn.</li>
  <li>On each turn that a ship is in a grappled state, if may attempt to
  ungrapple. If a ship is grappled more than once, it must ungrapple every
  successful grapple before it is free.</li>
  <li>A ship may attempt to ungrapple once per turn each successful
  grapple.</li>
  <li>If after completion of all ungrappling attempts, any ship still remains
  grappled to one or more enemy ships, it must wait till next turn to attempt
  to ungrapple.</li>
  <li>Ungrappling is indicated by writing a &quot;(G)&quot; in the notes
  section of the ship's log.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd08">VII. Boarding Preparation Phase</a></h2>
<p>Ships which have been fouled or successfully grappled may form boarding
parties if desired. These parties may attempt to take over an enemy ship or
defend against a take-over in the melee phase.</p>

<h3>A. Boarding Party Formation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All boarding parties are formed by crew sections. All available crew
  squares in a crew section must be used.</li>
  <li>From one to all sections may be delegated as a boarding party or parties
  as long as the following procedure is maintained:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The lowest crew section with at least one undestroyed crew square must
    be used first.</li>
    <li>Any remaining crew sections desired as boarding parties must be chosen
    in order. A player may never skip a lower numbered crew section to choose a
    higher numbered crew section as a boarding party unless all lower numbered
    sections have already been chosen as such.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Boarding Preparation Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Players secretly write down which crew sections are to be used for
  boarding in the notes section for all ships fouled and/or grappled. If the
  player does not desire to form any boarding parties &quot;NBP&quot; is
  written.</li>
  <li>There are three types of boarding parties which may be formed: An
  offensive boarding party written as &quot;OBP&quot; a defensive boarding
  party written as &quot;DBP&quot;, and a transfer boarding party written as
  &quot;TBP&quot;. (These abbreviations will be used to denote the boarding
  party types hereafter in the rules). An &quot;OBP&quot; must melee in the
  Melee Phase. A &quot;DBP&quot; will melee only if attacked by an opposing
  &quot;OBP&quot;. A &quot;TBP&quot; is used only for transfer of crews between
  friendly ships.</li>
  <li>To form a boarding party, the abbreviation for the type of boarding party
  desired is written in the Notes section plus each crew section number
  involved. More than one type boarding party may be formed per ship.</li>
  <li>If there are several ships to which a boarding party could board at the
  same time, the &quot;log&quot; notation should also indicate the ship(s) to
  be boarded.</li>
  <li>If all crew sections of a ship are used for boarding parties, that ship
  may not fire at all in the Combat Phase, or move in the next Movement
  Phase.</li>
  <li>Transfer of crews is allowed to any friendly adjacent ship, not
  necessarily one fouled or grappled.</li>
  <li>Transferred crews may not be used for melee or other purposes until the
  turn following the transfer. This applies even when the ship they are
  transferred to is engaged in melee during the turn of transfer.</li>
  <li>&quot;TBP's&quot; may be formed to board ships which one thinks will
  surrender. If, for any reason the ship does not surrender, no transfer is
  made and the crew section(s) involved may not be used in any other function
  for that turn.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd09">VIII. Combat Phase</a></h2>
<p>In this phase, ships may fire at enemy ships in their field of fire and
within range. Firing is considered simultaneous and all firing is considered
completed before results of combat are marked on the &quot;log&quot; sheets.
Firing is done by broadsides of cannon.</p>

<h3>A. Fire Determination</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Each ship has a right and left (in Naval terminology, starboard and port)
  broadside. These broadsides are effective only from their side of the ship.
  Each broadside has a &quot;play&quot; or area over which its broadside
  firepower is effective. The play of each broadside is shown on the following
  diagram<br>
  <img src="files/basicfof.gif" alt="Basic Field of Fire" width="350" height="249"></li>
  <li>Each ship also has two fields of fire; one for each broadside. Any
  blocking of one field, has no effect, whatsoever, on the other field of
  fire.</li>
  <li>The field of fire of each broadside is the area covered by the play of
  the broadside up to the limit of the ten hex firing range.</li>
  <li>A ship may fire at a single enemy ship in a broadside's field of fire
  subject to two conditions:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The ship being fired upon must be the closest in number of hexes to the
    firing ship of all ships in the field of fire;</li>
    <li>If the &quot;closest ship&quot; happens to be a land hex, friendly
    ship, surrendered or captured ship, or a hulk, the field of fire is blocked
    and the ship may not fire that broadside in that turn.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>If there is more than one ship or obstacle which qualifies as
  &quot;closest ship&quot;, the attacker may choose which is closest and fire
  at that ship.</li>
  <li>Firing is noted on the log by drawing a slant line (&quot;/&quot;)
  through the last loading notation &quot;R&quot; on the broadside fired.</li>
  <li>As firing is considered simultaneous, it may be carried out in any order.a
  Hits will not be marked until after all firing is completed.</li>
  <li>A ship may fire both broadsides during the same combat phase, if both
  sides are loaded.</li>
  <li>Carronades are a special type of gun. They can only be fired at ships
  within the two hex range. Carronade gun squares are added to the regular
  broadside capability.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Fire Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Count the number of hexes to the target by the shortest possible route.
  It may be to either the bow or stern hex, whichever is closest. This is the
  range.</li>
  <li>In the gun section of the firing ship's &quot;log&quot;, count the number
  of guns squares on the broadside firing. Do not include damaged gun squares
  in this count. Also, do not include carronade squares unless the range is two
  hexes or less.</li>
  <li>Consult the range tables of the Hit Determination Table&nbsp;(HDT), cross
  gridding the number of gun squares firing with the range in hexes. The number
  found in this table is the number of the Hit Table to be used.</li>
  <li>Check the HDT modifiers (ignore the advanced modifiers). These are
  variables that will increase or decrease the Hit Table. All modifiers are
  cumulative. If, after using all modifiers that apply, Table Zero or above has
  not been reached, the result is an automatic &quot;miss&quot;. If a table
  number higher than eight has been reached, use Table Eight, as this is the
  highest allowed.</li>
  <li>The player firing now decides if the fire is to be aimed at the hull, or
  at the rigging. If the range is six hexes or more, the fire must be aimed at
  the rigging.</li>
  <li>Consult the correct Hit Table, as determined in steps (3) and (4), in
  either the Hull or Rigging Effects Section, depending on the decision made in
  step (5), then roll one die. Crossgrid the number rolled with the proper Hit
  Table. The result gives the number and types of hits scored on the
  target.</li>
  <li>There are four types of hits: H&nbsp;(Hull), G&nbsp;(Gun), C&nbsp;(Crew),
  and R&nbsp;(Rigging). At the end of the Combat Phase, the number and type of
  hits are marked off in the appropriate sections of the target ship's
  &quot;log&quot;. Players may wish to keep track of these hits on a side sheet
  of paper until the end of the phase.</li>
  <li>Grappled and/or fouled ships may not fire at each other's rigging.</li>
</ol>

<h3>C. Hit Table Modifiers</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Crew quality: Crew quality will increase or decrease the BHT as shown in
  the HDT depending on the number of gun squares being fired.</li>
  <li>Raking: Raking (i.e., when one ship is in position to fire down the
  length of another one), will increase the BHT as shown in the HDT, depending
  on the number of gun squares firing. A ship is in a raking position anytime
  an opposing ship lies within the play of its broadside, but it lies outside
  the play of the opposing broadside.</li>
  <li>Crow Losses: For each complete crew section wiped out or used for
  boarding, the Hit Table is decreased by one. If no crew sections are
  available for firing, the guns may not be fired.</li>
  <li>Initial Broadside: The first time a ship fires a broadside, that
  broadside will be the most carefully loaded and aimed that it will fire. Each
  ship has two initial broadsides, one for each side of the ship. The initial
  broadside will increase the Hit Table as shown on the HDT, depending on the
  number of gun squares being fired in the broadside.</li>
  <li>Captured Ship: When using the guns of a captured ship, the Hit Table is
  decreased by two tables. Ignore the crew loss modifier when firing from a
  captured ship.</li>
</ol>

<h3>D. Marking Hits and the Effects of Damage</h3>
<p>Hits are marked on the &quot;log&quot; of the target ship with an
&quot;X&quot;. The &quot;log&quot; has four major parts, each part
corresponding to a type of hit on the Hit Table.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hull Hits (&quot;H&quot;)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Mark off one hull square per hull hit called for on the Hit Tables.</li>
    <li>When all of a ship's hull squares have been marked off, that ship will
    &quot;surrender by striking her colors&quot;. The ship is considered to be
    in such danger of sinking that it cannot be sailed or the guns worked for
    the remainder of the game (even by a prize crew). None of the original crew
    can be removed from the ship (all are required to try to keep the ship
    afloat). Neither side is allowed to fire on a &quot;struck&quot; ship,
    although it can be boarded. Excess hull hits are treated as
    &quot;misses&quot;. The crew of a &quot;surrender by striking&quot; ship
    cannot participate in melee even if boarding parties have been formed.
    Place a strike marker on a ship which has &quot;struck&quot;.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Crew Hits (&quot;C&quot;)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Mark off one crew square per crew hit called for on the Hit Tables. Alla
    crew hits must be taken out of the first section until all of its crew
    squares are gone, then from the second section. and finally from the third
    section.</li>
    <li>When all crew squares on a ship are marked off, the ship cannot be
    moved or be used in combat until more crew squares are put on board. Excess
    crew hits are treated as &quot;misses&quot;.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Gun Hits (&quot;G&quot;)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Mark off one gun square per gun hit called for on the Hit Tables. When
    a gun hit is called for, and the ship has carronade squares available, the
    commander of the hit ship can mark off whichever type he chooses. Hits
    should be marked off the side closest to the firing ship, although if gun
    squares on the closer side are all marked off, gun squares on the opposite
    side are marked off. If, as in a rake, both sides of the target ship are
    equidistant to the firing ship, the target ship chooses which gun squares
    to mark off.</li>
    <li>If all gun squares are marked off, and no friendly ship of the same or
    larger class as the firing ship is within ten squares distance, the ship
    will surrender to the first enemy ship that can move into an adjacent hex
    and fire a broadside into it. The ten hex range is determined at the moment
    the broadside is fired. This is known as &quot;surrender by
    firepower&quot;. Excess gun hits are treated as hull hits.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Rigging Hits (&quot;R&quot;)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Mark off one rigging square per rigging hit called for on the Hit
    Tables. The rigging squares are divided into either three sections (for
    ships with a battle sail speed of 3) or four sections (for ships with a
    battle sail speed of 4). All rigging hits are taken out of the first
    section until all rigging squares are gone there, then out of the second
    section, etc. Each complete rigging section marked off drops the ship's
    movement allowance by one hex in all attitudes to the wind. When all
    rigging sections are gone, the ship cannot move.</li>
    <li>If all rigging squares are marked off, and no friendly ship of the same
    or larger class as the firing ship is within ten squares distance, the ship
    will surrender to the first enemy ship which can rake its hull. This is
    known as &quot;surrender by immobility&quot;. Excess rigging hits are
    treated as &quot;misses&quot;.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd10">IX. Melee Phase</a></h2>
<p>All ships which have not &quot;surrendered&quot; and have crew squares
remaining in their boarding parties may now attempt to capture opposing ships,
to defend themselves and/or to transfer to friendly ships. To determine the
success of the boarding, melee must occur with the enemy's &quot;OBP&quot; or
&quot;DBP&quot;. Melee is fought simultaneously once per turn.</p>

<h3>A. Transfer Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Crew sections designated as &quot;TBP&quot; during the Boarding
  Preparation Phase may now transfer as ordered to any friendly adjacent
  ship.</li>
  <li>Cross off the transferred crewsections on the &quot;log&quot; as if they
  were casualties, and make a note on a separate sheet of paper of the
  strengths of the transferred crew sections, and their present locations.
  Friendly crews ordered to transfer to ships which have
  &quot;surrendered&quot; in the Combat Phase may not transfer.</li>
  <li>If crew sections are transferring to ships which have lost crew squares,
  they may permanently transfer by erasing one crew square for each square
  being transferred. Start erasing with the most recent crew square casualty
  and work back.</li>
  <li>Crew sections transferred to a ship immediately assume the quality of the
  original crew. If a crew section is being transferred to a ship involved in
  melee, the crew may not participate in the melee nor return to the original
  ship, and surrenders with the rest of the non-meleeing crew if the ship
  surrenders in that turn.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Boarding Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ships which have formed &quot;OBP's&quot; during the Boarding Preparation Phase must now attempt to have their &quot;0BP's&quot; board and capture by melee the opposing enemy ships to which they have been ordered. Only &quot;OBP's&quot; initiate melee.</li>
  <li>If two opposing ships are simultaneously sending &quot;OBP's&quot; to capture each other, both parties must melee.</li>
  <li>If one of the opposing ships has ordered a &quot;DBP&quot;, melee occurs if she is attacked by an &quot;OBP&quot;. If the other ship has a &quot;DBP&quot;, &quot;TBP&quot;, or &quot;NBP&quot; then no melee occurs.</li>
  <li>If an &quot;0BP&quot; (not &quot;DBP&quot;) boards a ship which has ordered a &quot;NBP&quot; or &quot;TBP&quot; only, that &quot;OBP&quot; automatically captures the ship without melee. The &quot;TBP&quot; would effect its transfer simultaneously.</li>
  <li>If several &quot;OBP's&quot; are boarding the same ship, their total melee strengths are added together.</li>
  <li>If an &quot;OBP&quot; is ordered to board a ship which has ordered both an &quot;OBP&quot; and a &quot;DBP&quot;, the two &quot;OBP's&quot; must melee first. If victorious the &quot;OBP&quot; must continue melee with the &quot;DBP&quot;.</li>
  <li>If an enemy ship &quot;surrenders&quot; during the Combat Phase, an &quot;OBP&quot; intended for that ship may go aboard to act as prize crew.</li>
</ol>

<h3>C. Melee Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Each crew square involved in a melee is worth a certain number of melee factors dependent on the ship's crew quality. The number of combat factors each crew square is worth is given on the Crew Melee Strength Table. Each side multiplies the number of crew squares in the melee times the number of combat factors per crew square to find the Total Melee Strength&nbsp;(TMS) in the melee.</li>
  <li>Melee is conducted simultaneously, each player rolling one die and consulting the Melee Resolution Table. The number rolled on the die is cross-gridded with his TMS. The result is the number of enemy crew squares to be marked off on the lowest crew section of the boarding party.</li>
  <li>Melee once initiated must continue until one ship surrenders, ships become ungrappled or unfouled, or both sides disengage by mutual consent. If after three rounds no conclusion is reached, melee must continue the next turn.</li>
  <li>Crew sections already engaged in melee may not quit until one of the conditions in 3 above has been met. New crew sections may be added to the melee each turn if available.</li>
  <li>A victorious &quot;DBP&quot; has the option of boarding the opposing ship. When the &quot;DBP&quot; boards it automatically changes status to &quot;OBP&quot; and must continue melee for the remaining rounds if necessary.</li>
  <li>If two different crews are combined in melee, the controlling player selects where losses are taken.</li>
</ol>

<h3>D. Capturing Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Any ship which surrenders in any of four ways either by
  &quot;striking&quot;, &quot;firepower&quot;, &quot;melee&quot; or
  &quot;immobility&quot; may be captured.</li>
  <li>A ship which surrenders by melee is automatically captured by the
  victorious boarding party which is considered to be on the deck of the ship
  the enemy boarding party came from. It now becomes the prize crew.</li>
  <li>A ship which surrenders by any other means is captured when either a
  &quot;TBP&quot; or &quot;OBP&quot; is placed aboard. The boarding party
  becomes the prize crew (See 11118. 8. of the Basic Game).
<p class="Error">(Meaningless cross-reference...)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Surrendered ships may not fire their guns, melee, or move as long as they
  are surrendered.</li>
  <li>A prize crew runs the ship normally while on board. They can sail the
  ship, engage in melees, and fire and load the guns (but at two tables less
  than normal).</li>
  <li>Once a ship is captured, the victorious player opens a new column on his
  &quot;log&quot; sheet for the captured ship, copying all information
  (including damage) from the old enemy &quot;log&quot;.</li>
  <li>The original crew is still marked on the ship's crew section of the
  &quot;log&quot;. The prize crew is kept on a separate sheet of paper.</li>
  <li>If for any reason a prize crew leaves, or is eliminated, the ship returns
  to the control of the original owner.</li>
  <li>At least one crew square of the prize crew is required for every six
  prisoner crew squares on a ship. If the numbers fall below this ratio, the
  prisoners immediately take over the ship, and the prize crew becomes
  prisoners.</li>
  <li>The captured ship assumes the quality of the prize crew.</li>
  <li>If a ship with a prize crew on board is fired upon, take all
  &quot;odd&quot; crew square losses (i.e., the first, third, fifth, etc.
  losses) that occurs in a Combat Phase from the prize crew and all
  &quot;even&quot; losses from the prisoners. Remember that ships with all hull
  squares marked out cannot be fired upon.</li>
  <li>Ships which have &quot;surrendered by striking&quot; may never fire their
  guns nor sail even if captured. The prize crew can melee.</li>
  <li>Ships that surrender automatically become friendly.</li>
  <li>If at any time a ship which has surrendered other than by striking is
  within five hexes (inclusive) of a friendly ship at the beginning of the turn, it ceases to be surrendered and may begin normal functions the next turn. It does not lose any of its damage though. It is still subject to surrender if the necessary conditions occur again.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd11">X. Loading Phase</a></h2>
<p>Ships should have their broadsides loaded in the beginning of the scenario.
Reloading of fired broadsides takes place in the last phase of the turn.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>A ship can load one complete broadside per turn. Only one side can be
  loaded, not both.</li>
  <li>A broadside can be loaded in the same turn that it is fired, and fired
  again during the following turn, or any later turn. Thus it is possible for
  the same broadside to be fired every turn.</li>
  <li>In the Basic Game only roundshot may be fired. Reloading is indicated in
  the &quot;log&quot; by writing the letter &quot;R&quot; under the
  &quot;R&quot; or &quot;L&quot; column of the load section at the appropriate
  turn number.</li>
  <li>A broadside may be fired even if there are no targets, but the advantage
  of initial broadside is lost.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd12">XI. Victory Conditions</a></h2>
<p>Victory conditions depend upon the scenario. Any special conditions will be
written in the appropriate scenario. General victory conditions will be split
into two categories; those for single ship scenarios and those for multi-ship
scenarios.</p>

<h3>A. Single Ship Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>Single ship scenarios end when one ship &quot;surrenders&quot;. The other
player is the victor. There is no time limit for this. Other situations that
qualify are printed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a player refuses to have combat and continually moves his ship out of
  the enemy's ship's range, he is considered the loser. This is not an explicit
  rule so some intelligence must be used to implement it. Its function is to
  keep partially damaged ships from attempting to draw by avoiding victory
  conditions.</li>
  <li>If both ships &quot;surrender&quot; simultaneously, it is a draw.</li>
  <li>Loss of all crew squares will automatically end the game with victory for
  the other side, even if that side &quot;strikes&quot;.</li>
  <li>As soon as the victory conditions are met, the game ends at that point,
  and the turn is not completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Multi-Ship Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>In Multi-ship scenarios, special victory conditions are printed with the
scenario. Some general rules follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each ship has a point value written in its order of battle.</li>
  <li>Ships which strike give the opposing player that ship's point value.</li>
  <li>Ships which have been captured count twice the value to the opposing
  player.</li>
  <li>At the end of the scenario, all points are counted and the player with
  the highest amount is declared the winner.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="header" name="hd13">XII. Miscellaneous</a></h2>
<p>Except for scenarios where land hexes are present, or where land is defined
as being just off a certain edge of the mapboard, it should be possible for
players to keep from sailing off the mapboard by the expedient of moving all
counters a certain number of hexes in the same direction. This method,
maintains the ship's relative positions to one another.</p>

<p>At other times when all ships have moved to one side of the board, it will
be advantageous to merely lift the now unused half of the board and place it on
the other side of the portion of the board now containing all vessels.</p>
